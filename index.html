<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This project implements the Luhn algorithm, a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers like credit card numbers. It's a practical exercise in algorithm implementation, demonstrating skills in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>String manipulation and array operations</li>
      <li>Implementing mathematical algorithms in code</li>
      <li>Basic error handling and input validation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The code showcases my ability to translate a real-world algorithm into functional code, balancing efficiency and readability. It's a small but focused project that reflects my interest in foundational computer science concepts and their practical applications.</p>
